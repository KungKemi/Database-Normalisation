# Database-Normalisation
This program provides a text-based UI and GUI, both of which can be used to create relations, define dependencies, and perform normalisation calculations.

These calculations can be used to better inform the efficient development of a relational database, and minimise the dependencies required.

The UI can be interacted with via the command line. The GUI was developed using tkinter.
